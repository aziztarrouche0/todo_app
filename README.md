 I got the main idea for this project from a YouTube channel.  
After watching the concept, I built the to-do app myself and wrote all the code on my own.

# 📝 To-Do App
A simple and clean to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You can add tasks, delete them, and your list is automatically saved using localStorage.

# **I built this project to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I’d be happy to hear any feedback or suggestions!**
